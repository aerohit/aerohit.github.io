  <p>I am Rohit, solving first world problems as a Software Engineer at
  <a href="https://www.treatwell.nl" target="_blank">TreatWell</a>
  in Amsterdam. Previously I was helping people go around the world at
  <a href="http://www.vakantiediscounter.nl" target="_blank">de Vakantie Discounter</a>.
  I am a Journeyman Functional Programmer, dabbling in Scala and
  Clojure at work and Haskell at home. I have experience in developing for the web,
  mobile and cloud based distributed applications. I consider myself as language
  and technology agnostic. And, I am good at flying Vim.</p>

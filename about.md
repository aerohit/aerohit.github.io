I am Rohit, currently working as a Software Developer at [VakantieDiscounter](www.vakantiediscounter.nl)
in Amsterdam. I have experience in developing for the web, mobile and cloud
based distributed applications. I also have experience in developement of
scalable storage for big data and parallel numerical simulations using MPI
libraries. I have developed in Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Java, Ruby, Python,
JavaScript, C++, Bash and Fortran.

I consider myself as language and technology agnostic. I could be contacted via email.
